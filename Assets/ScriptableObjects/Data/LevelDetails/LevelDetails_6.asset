  _levelDescription: 'The climactic battle for Terranor has arrived. The Arcanists,
    in a desperate bid for power, have launched an attack to seize control of the
    kingdom. Meanwhile, the remaining Rebel forces, determined to avoid subjugation
    by either side, have joined the fray in a last-ditch effort to defeat their enemies
    and secure their independence. The Loyalists now face their greatest challenge
    yet: to defeat both the Arcanists and the Rebels, banish the Arcanist Mage King,
    and finally reunite the fractured kingdom under one banner.'
