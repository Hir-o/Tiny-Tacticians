  _levelDescription: The Loyalists are caught off guard as the Arcanists uncover
    a weak point in their defenses. The strategically vital Loyalist castle stands
    vulnerable with minimal protection. Seizing this opportunity, the Arcanists launch
    a swift and aggressive attack. Unbeknownst to them, Rebel spies have intercepted
    their plans and are also racing to capture the castle first. In a desperate scramble
    for control, the Loyalists must quickly rally to defend their besieged fortress
    against two formidable foes.
