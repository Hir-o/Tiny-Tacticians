  _levelDescription: The war for Terranor enters a critical phase as the Loyalists,
    Arcanists, and Rebels each hold a pivotal stronghold in a fiercely contested
    region. To secure their dominance and pave the way for reunification, the Loyalists
    must undertake the formidable task of capturing the strongholds controlled by
    their rivals. Only by seizing these key positions can the Loyalists establish
    full control over the area and turn the tide of war in their favor.
