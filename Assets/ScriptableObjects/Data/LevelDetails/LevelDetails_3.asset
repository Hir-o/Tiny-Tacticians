  _levelDescription: "With the Arcanist threat temporarily subdued, the Loyalists
    are more determined than ever to reclaim Terranor and restore the rightful order.
    They now turn their attention to another pressing conflict. The Rebels, emboldened
    by the kingdom\u2019s fragmentation, seek to secede and establish their own republic.
    Their defiance has resulted in the loss of crucial territories, weakening the
    Loyalists' hold on the realm. The time has come to reclaim these lands and restore
    unity."
