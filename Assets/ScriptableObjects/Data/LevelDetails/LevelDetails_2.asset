  _levelName: 'II: The Eliminated King'
  _levelDescription: "The king of Terranor has been eliminated, leading to the division
    of the realms. \n\nThe revelation that the Arcanists were behind this treacherous
    act has ignited a fire of righteous fury within your ranks. \n\nTheir betrayal
    splintered the once-united kingdom, and now they seek to crown their own Mage
    King, a puppet ruler to bend the realm to their will. It is time to strike back."
