  _title: Movement
  _description: When you select a unit by clicking on it with the mouse button, the
    places it can move to are highlighted. All units have a certain number of movement
    points, which dictate how many tiles that unit can move per turn. Normally, moving
    one tile on flat or forest terrain uses one movement point. <u>To move, click
    on a unit and then your destination.
  _objectiveDescription: '1. Click on the spearman unit to select it

    the spearman unit selected, click on a highlighted tile to move it'
